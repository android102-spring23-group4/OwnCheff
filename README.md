Will give a new recipe everyday to make at home. Uses the TheMealDB/Zestful API, zestful will allow the user to make a decision for alternative ingredients so the user doesn't have to buy a bunch of ingredients that they would use for only 1 recipe. Would allow users to swipe for recipes they liked and disliked and then would cater to the users likes for future recipes.
